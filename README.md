MATLAB codes supporting 'Agent-based Modelling of Sports Riots' (Clements and Fadai, 2021)

Two agent-based models, along with their associated continuum limits, are included in this repository. The first ABM (RIOTS_ABM_Unif) describes agents with spatially-unform initial conditions. Its associated continuum limit is also computed via the helper ODE m-file RIOTS_ODE. The second ABM (RIOTS_ABM_Spatial) describes agents with spatially-dependent initial conditions. Its associated continuum limit is also computed via the helper PDE m-file RIOTS_PDE.
